~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Notes:
We got our GUI to work, and completed all 7 classes in the Candy hierarchy! Everything we've written so far has been tested, and we have a basic outline of our actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method already prepared, to make finishing the GUI that much easier. We also learned about the wonders of "git pull --rebase" after our branches failed to merge successfully.

Completed:
  * Tested branch creation, commits, and merging
  * Tested if each username was shown after a commit
  * Created separate branch for the GUI, started basic outline
  * Finished project prototype
  * Researched GUI tables
  * Wrote Candy, RegularCandy, and SpecialCandy class
  * Tested Candy and RegularCandy
