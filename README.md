## Instructions

TBD

## Development Log
## 01/13
Completed:
 * Reformatted GUI to include score, and restart button within a system of nested Layouts
 * Wrote several methods to detect and find existing combinations on the board
 * Researching ActionListener interface
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
In Progress:
 * Finishing Window.java for the GUI
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Pending:
 * Potential additional features (e.g. animations)
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Notes:
We had to research how to nest Layouts and set margins in order to balance the grid, the score, and the restart button in one GUI, and ended up learning a lot of new syntax, most of which we didn't use (like rigid areas, glue, etc.).

## 01/10
Completed:
 * Finished writing and testing all Candy subclasses
 * Finished researching importing images in GUI
 * Incorporated images into GUI
 * Added a restart button, and a label to show the score
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
In Progress:
 * Writing Window.java for the GUI
 * Researching ActionListener interface
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Pending:
 * Potential additional features (e.g. animations)
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Notes:
We got our GUI to work, and completed all 7 classes in the Candy hierarchy! Everything we've written so far has been tested, and we have a basic outline of our actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method already prepared, to make finishing the GUI that much easier. We also learned about the wonders of "git pull --rebase" after our branches failed to merge successfully.


## 01/07
Completed:
  * Tested branch creation, commits, and merging
  * Tested if each username was shown after a commit
  * Created separate branch for the GUI, started basic outline
  * Finished project prototype
  * Researched GUI tables
  * Wrote Candy, RegularCandy, and SpecialCandy class
  * Tested Candy and RegularCandy
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
In Progress:
 * Writing Window.java for the GUI
 * Researching ActionListener interface
 * Testing SpecialCandy class
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Pending:
 * Writing SpecialCandy subclasses
 * Potential additional features
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Notes:
We are in the process of making a GUI interface, and will finish the Candy class within the next few days.

### 12/14
Completed:
  * Project Outline (.txt file)
  * GitHub repository creation and collaborator confirmation
  * Project Proposal
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
In Progress:
  * Writing class outlines (.java file)
  * Researching GUI capabilities
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Pending:
  * Creating GUI (must finish within two days)
    * Must learn how to import pictures
  * Writing and testing Window Class
  * Writing and testing Candy Class (and all subclasses)
  * Potential additional features
~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~
Notes:
We have written our project proposal, created the repository on GitHub, and outlined what our project should look like (how it would behave, etc.). Within the next week, our goal is to research GUI, and write a class outline for all the classes (data fields, method signatures, etc.).
